    "## Traveling Salesman problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The essense of traveling salesman problem is to find a minimum cost (minimum distance) path for a salesman to visit all the cities.\n",
    "The cost can be easily realized by having:\n",
    "$$\\sum_i a_ix_i=MIN,$$ \n",
    "which is the first term in the QUBO function. However, this is not enough, as it will simply result in $x_i=0$ as the minimum energy solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct mapping of the problem of traveling salesman to the QUBO function is not a straightforward thing. One of the strategy is to associate each connection between two cities to a specific $x_i$ parameter. Then for a minimum problem of 5 cities we will have the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "|---|A|B|C|D|E|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|A|---|$x_1$|$x_2$|$x_3$|$x_4$|\n",
    "|B|---|---|$x_5$|$x_6$|$x_7$|\n",
    "|C|---|---|---|$x_8$|$x_8$|\n",
    "|D|---|---|---|---|$x_{10}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a construction, the constrain is to have for a sum of horizontal and vertical for a given city (e.g., B) equaling exactly 2, so the each city is only visited once and connected twice to other cities. Considering city A, this gives us the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 2$ which leads to $(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 -2)^2=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "==> $\\sum_{i=1,4}x_i + 2\\sum_{i>j=1,4} x_i x_j - 4\\sum_{i=1,4}x_i + 4 = MIN$\n",
    "\n",
    "When one considers other cities, the following $a$ vector and $b$ matrix elements are obtained:\n",
    "$$a_i=-6$$\n",
    "and for all considered {$x_i,x_j$} combinations\n",
    "$$b_{i,j}=2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem could be easily generalized to the case of $N$ cities, which you have provided in the python script below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must multiply this constrain by a well selected $\\alpha$ parameter, e.g. 500, to put it on equall footing with the main $a_i$ elements reflecting the distances.\n",
    "The best formulated problem for D-wave has non-zero values of $a$ vector and $b$ matrix having similar values, i.e. not varying by more that factor of ~5.\n",
