    "Despite the similarity, the acronym QUBO, by itself, has nothing to do with \"qubits\" or \"quantum\"! A QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) is a classical optimization problem, consisting in **minimizing** a quadratic cost function of the form $$ f(\\{x_i\\})\\ =\\ \\sum_{i\\leq j = 1}^n \\,Q_{i,j}\\,x_i\\,x_j\\ =\\ \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}\\,\\mathbf{x}$$ where $\\{x_i\\}$ is a set of binary variables, i.e., $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This type of problem is often encountered in combinatorics for finance/economics, one famous example is the *travelling salesman* problem, see Exercise 1. The same mathematical form is also frequently found in optimization problems for materials science, as we will see in Exercise 2. It is interesting to note that binary variables fulfill $x_i = x_i^2$. Therefore, the QUBO cost function can also be written in the form $$ f(\\{x_i\\})\\ =\\ \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\,Q_{i,i}\\,x_i + \\sum_{i<j = 1}^n \\,Q_{i,j}\\,x_i\\,x_j$$ with linear and quadratic terms."

Here, we interpret the state $\\sigma_i = |{\\uparrow}\\rangle$ as $x_i = 1$ and $\\sigma_i = |{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ as $x_i = 0$. In other words: **The ground state of the spin (qubit) network with such Hamiltonian is directly equivalent to the solution of the corresponding (classical) QUBO minimization problem.** We can therefore solve the QUBO problem by determining the ground state of the qubit network with a suitable Hamiltonian."

    "The coupling strengths of the physical qubit network in a quantum annealer can be tuned, e.g., by applying certain magnetic fields. This allows to implement the desired Hamiltonian. However, finding the corresponding ground state is still challenging. For this, the **adiabatic theorem** of quantum mechanics is employed: If a system is subject to a Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}(t)$ with a \"very\" slow time dependence and the system is in the initial ground state $|{\\Psi_0(t=0)}\\rangle$ of $\\mathcal{H}(t=0)$, then the system will adiabatically remain in the (time-dependent) ground state of $\\mathcal{H}(t)$."

    "This behavior can be exploited for solving the QUBO problem: The many-qubit system is first prepared in the easily achievable ground state $|{\\Psi_0}\\rangle$ of some \"easy\" initial Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_0$. Then the coupling strengths are \"slowly\" adjusted to adiabatically turn $\\mathcal{H}_0$ into the desired $\\mathcal{H}_z$ encoding our QUBO problem, $\\mathcal{H}_0 \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}_z$. If the process is sufficicently slow, then the system remains in the corresponding ground state, yielding the ground state of $\\mathcal{H}_z$ as final state, $|{\\Psi_0}\\rangle \\longrightarrow |{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{sol}}}\\rangle$. By measuring the final state of the system, we thus directly obtain the solution of the classical QUBO problem, e.g., $|{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{sol}}}\\rangle = |{0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,...}\\rangle$. The process of slowly (adiabatically) turning the \"easy\" initial (ground) state into the final ground state of the target Hamiltonian is called **quantum annealing**."

The reason is that any QUBO problem will be encoded in a certain Hamiltonian, which effectively describes the energy of the multi-qubit system. As described above, the quantum annealing process results in the ground state, i.e., lowest-energy state, of the target Hamiltonian."
