    "## Putting constrains on QUBO function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will learn basics of optimization performed on D-Wave quantum annealer. We start with the QUBO function:\n",
    "$$F(x_i)=\\sum_i^N a_ix_i + \\sum_{i<j}^N b_{ij} x_i x_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how to map a problem into the QUBO function and how D-Wave finds its minimum, we first play with {$x_i$} vector of length three: {$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$}.\n",
    "We put constrain on the sum of the $x_i$ elements to be $N$=0,1,2,3. One can realize this by the following QUBO function:\n",
    "$$(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i-N)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It results in the following expansion: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i-N)^2=(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i)^2-2N(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i)+N^2$$\n",
    "$$=(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i^2)+2(\\sum_{i>j}^{3}x_ix_j)-2N(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i)+N^2$$\n",
    "$$=(1-2N)\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i+2\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_ix_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives the following $a_i$ and $b_{ij}$ coefficients:\n",
    "$$a_i=1-2N$$\n",
    "$$b_{ij}=2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so we deliver to D-wave the following $a$ vector and $b$ matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a=\\begin{bmatrix} \n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we would like to avoid a solution with $x_2$=$x_3$=1. How to do this?\n",
    "We force larger parameter $b_{23}$. Please try 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10., 50. and see what will happen.\n",

    "## Traveling Salesman problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The essense of traveling salesman problem is to find a minimum cost (minimum distance) path for a salesman to visit all the cities.\n",
    "The cost can be easily realized by having:\n",
    "$$\\sum_i a_ix_i=MIN,$$ \n",
    "which is the first term in the QUBO function. However, this is not enough, as it will simply result in $x_i=0$ as the minimum energy solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct mapping of the problem of traveling salesman to the QUBO function is not a straightforward thing. One of the strategy is to associate each connection between two cities to a specific $x_i$ parameter. Then for a minimum problem of 5 cities we will have the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "|---|A|B|C|D|E|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|A|---|$x_1$|$x_2$|$x_3$|$x_4$|\n",
    "|B|---|---|$x_5$|$x_6$|$x_7$|\n",
    "|C|---|---|---|$x_8$|$x_8$|\n",
    "|D|---|---|---|---|$x_{10}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a construction, the constrain is to have for a sum of horizontal and vertical for a given city (e.g., B) equaling exactly 2, so the each city is only visited once and connected twice to other cities. Considering city A, this gives us the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1$ + $x_2$ + $x_3$ + $x_4$  = 2 which leads to $(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 -2)^2=0$ => $\\sum_{i=1,4}x_i$ + 2$\\sum_{i>j=1,4}$$x_i$$x_j$-4$\\sum_{i=1,4}x_i$+4=MIN\n",
    "\n",
    "When one considers other cities, the following a vector and b matrix elements are obtained:\n",
    "$$a_i=-6$$\n",
    "and for all considered {$x_i,x_j$} combinations\n",
    "$$b_{i,j}=2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem could me easily generalized to the case of $N$ cities, which you have provided in the python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must multiply this constrain by a well selected $\\alpha$ parameter, e.g. 500., to put it on equall footing with the main $a_i$ elements reflecting the distances.\n",
    "The best formulated problem for D-wave has non-zero values of a vector and b matrix having similar values, i.e. not varying by more that factor of ~5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided python script does it automatically for a given $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first complex problem we solve is the travelng between 5 German cities: Cologne, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Dresden. The distances between the cities are provided in the following distance chart:\n",
